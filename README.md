Qthreads - UserSpace cooperative threading library

## What is it?

1. This project implements a User-space thread library in C, like the POSIX threads library.
2. It implements â€œgreen threads", i.e. cooperative threads with no preemption.

## Usage?

1\. The functions provided by the thread library allow users to implement their own functions which accept a single argument, pass a pointer and a variable to thread on creation, and manage the thread execution with mutex variables, condition variables, and thread join functions.
### Usage Samples in test files: [a relative link](test1.c)

## What are its limitations?

1. Only developed and supported on Ubuntu for x86 and aarch64 systems. The context switching function (saving and switching between stack pointers between 2 threads) is written in assembly and supported in Ubuntu only.
2. Does not support pre-emption, only cooperative threading, with the expectation that the user of this threading library will use thread yielding function appropriately & frequently to avoid deadlock scenarios.
3. Does not support more than 32 sleeping threads at a single time.
4. Does not support more than 1 thread waiting at join for a thread to exit.

## Thread Structure / Representation

struct qthread { /\* your code here \*/; struct qthread \*next;

/\* need this stack base pointer to let us free space allocated for stack once thread exits \*/ void \*stack; void \*saved_sp; int exited_flag; void \*exit_val;

struct qthread \*waiting_for_me; /\* pointer to thread waiting for this thread to exit to do join \*/ long wake_time;

};

## Functions Provided:

### Thread library initialization:

- void qthread_init(void) = function to initialize the threading library and its structures/variables for proper thread queueing/scheduling. Maintains a struct to represent the original OS created thread which calls this library.

### Thread management:

- qthread_t qthread_create(f_1arg_t f, void \*arg1) = function to create a thread structure with appropriate thread management variables and accepts a function pointer(f_1arg_t f), and parameter pointer (void \*arg1), which is to be passed to function to be executed by the thread.
- void qthread_exit(void \*val) = called by qthread_create after execution of the of the function passed in qthread_create. The exit function accepts a return value from the function executed.qthread_exit sets this value in the thread structure and puts any threads waiting for current thread exit to join on the active queue of threads.
- void qthread_yield(void) = function to put current running thread to the end of the active threads queue and execute thread at the front of the active threads queue.
- void \*qthread_join(qthread_t thread) = function which accepts a pointer to a thread, and waits for the thread to exit and then get its return value. This function allows a thread to be joined by the current running thread.

### Mutexes and condition variables:

- qthread_mutex_t \*qthread_mutex_create(void) = creates a mutex queue & lock variable
- void qthread_mutex_lock(qthread_mutex_t \*m) = acquires lock, or puts in mutex_queue
- void qthread_mutex_unlock(qthread_mutex_t \*m) = releases lock
- void qthread_mutex_destroy(qthread_mutex_t \*m) = destroys/frees mutex variable
- qthread_cond_t \*qthread_cond_init(qthread_cond_t \*c) = creates a condition variable queue
- void qthread_cond_wait(qthread_cond_t \*c, qthread_mutex_t \*m) = puts current thread onto condition variable queue
- void qthread_cond_signal(qthread_cond_t \*c) = wakes up first thread in condition variable queue by putting it on the active queue
- void qthread_cond_broadcast(qthread_cond_t \*c) = wakes up all threads in condition variable queue and puts them all on active queue
- void qthread_cond_destroy(qthread_cond_t \*c) = destroys/frees condition variable

### Sleeping Threads 
 - void qthread_usleep(long int usecs) = puts currently running thread to sleep for usec amount of microseconds, sleeping threads maintained in an array holding 32 pointers to thread structs/null, thus sleeping threads limit is 32.
